<h3 class="creator">A Test Study by MS</h3>

<h2 class="smalltitle1">What is Coffee?</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. 
    Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, 
    primarily due to its caffeine content. 
    It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks</p>

    <h2 class="smalltitle1">How is Coffee made and where is it from?</h2>

    <h3 class="paragraph">Seeds of the "Coffea plant's" fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. 
        The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water 
        before being filtered out, 
        producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. 
        Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, 
        caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream 
        are often used to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.</h3>

        <h2 class="smalltitle1">The History of Coffee</h2>

    <h3 class="paragraphtitle">The Origins</h3>

    <h3 class="paragraph">There are multiple anecdotal origin stories which lack evidence. 
        In a commonly repeated legend, Kaldi, a 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd,
        first observed the coffee plant after seeing his flock energized by chewing on the plant.
        This legend does not appear before 1671, first being related by Antoine Faustus Nairon, 
        a Maronite professor of Oriental languages and author of one of the first printed treatises devoted to coffee, 
        De Saluberrima potione Cahue seu Cafe nuncupata Discurscus (Rome, 1671), indicating the story is likely apocryphal.
        Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. Omar, starving after being exiled from Mocha, found berries. 
        After attempting to chew and roast them, Omar boiled them, which yielded a liquid that revitalized and sustained him.</h3>
